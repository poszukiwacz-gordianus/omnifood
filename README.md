## The Omnifood website

This is the final project from Jonas Schmedtmann's <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/design-and-develop-a-killer-website-with-html5-and-css3">Build Responsive Real-World Websites with HTML and CSS Course</a>.

## What I Changed from the Original:

I rebuilt this website using Next.js and Tailwind CSS to enhance performance and modernize the development stack.

## Deployed on Vercel
